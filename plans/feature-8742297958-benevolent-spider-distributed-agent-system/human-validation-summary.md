# Natural Language Summary for Human Validation

**Feature**: Benevolent Spider Distributed Agent System  
**Feature ID**: 8742297958  
**TLA+ Specification**: BenevolentSpiderSystem.tla  
**Validation Status**: Ready for Human Approval

## What This System Does (In Plain English)

This is a **secure distributed computing system** that allows computers to voluntarily share their idle processing power while maintaining **complete user control and privacy protection**. Here's how it works:

### 1. Voluntary Participation (No Uninvited Contact)

Instead of "crawling" the internet to find computers, the system uses **opt-in discovery channels**:

- **DNS TXT Records**: Users can publish `_askee.example.com TXT "v=1;consent=ready;pubkey=..."`
- **Well-Known URLs**: Users can place a file at `https://example.com/.well-known/askee-participation`
- **QR Codes**: Users can generate QR codes with participation metadata

**This means**: No computer will ever be contacted unless the user has explicitly signaled they want to participate.

### 2. Explicit Consent with Cryptographic Tokens

When a user signals interest, they receive a **detailed proposal** showing exactly:

- What types of computational tasks will run
- Maximum resource usage (e.g., 50% CPU, 2GB RAM, 10GB storage)
- Duration and renewal terms
- How to revoke consent instantly

If the user agrees, they receive a **cryptographic consent token** that acts like a digital contract. This token:

- Cannot be forged or tampered with
- Has built-in expiration dates
- Can be revoked instantly by the user
- Limits exactly what the system can do

### 3. Operating System-Level Security Sandboxes

Before any work begins, the system creates **OS-specific security containers**:

**On Linux**: Uses cgroups v2, seccomp filters, and namespaces to completely isolate the agent
**On Windows**: Uses Job Objects, AppContainer, and WDAC policies for containment
**On macOS**: Uses task_policy, Sandbox.kext, and TCC permissions for restriction

**This means**: The distributed agent runs in a secure "box" and cannot access:

- Personal files or documents
- Browser data or passwords
- System settings or credentials
- Network resources beyond its assigned tasks

### 4. Intelligent User Activity Detection

The system continuously monitors for user activity through:

- CPU usage patterns
- Keyboard and mouse input
- Application focus changes
- Network activity spikes

**When user activity is detected**: All distributed computing **immediately stops** and resources are released. The user's work always takes priority.

### 5. Reputation-Based Byzantine Fault Tolerance

To prevent malicious actors from disrupting the network:

- Each node maintains a **reputation score** (0-100) based on reliability and accuracy
- Tasks are assigned to **multiple nodes** (minimum 2, maximum 3) for verification
- Results must achieve **consensus** between honest nodes
- **Byzantine (malicious) nodes** are automatically detected and excluded
- Only high-reputation nodes (score ≥ 70) can participate in sensitive tasks

### 6. Zero Personal Data Access

The system is designed with **zero-knowledge architecture**:

- No access to personal files, photos, or documents
- No monitoring of user behavior or browsing habits
- No collection of personal information
- All task data is computational only (e.g., machine learning training, scientific simulations)

### 7. Complete Audit Trail

Every action is **cryptographically logged** with:

- Timestamps and digital signatures
- Resource usage measurements
- Task assignments and results
- Security policy enforcement
- User activity detection events

### 8. Instant Consent Revocation

Users can **immediately revoke consent** at any time:

- All distributed computing stops instantly
- Sandbox containers are terminated
- Network connections are closed
- Local agent is removed
- Audit logs are preserved for transparency

## Safety Guarantees (What Can Never Happen)

1. **No Unauthorized Access**: The system cannot perform any action without a valid, non-revoked consent token
2. **Resource Protection**: Resource usage will never exceed the limits specified in the user's consent
3. **User Priority**: User activity will always trigger immediate resource yielding
4. **Security Isolation**: The system cannot break out of its sandbox or access restricted data
5. **Byzantine Protection**: Malicious nodes cannot corrupt task results due to redundant verification

## Liveness Guarantees (What Will Eventually Happen)

1. **Discovery Progress**: Published participation signals will eventually be verified and processed
2. **Consent Processing**: Valid participation requests will eventually receive consent tokens
3. **Sandbox Creation**: Assessed nodes will eventually be properly sandboxed and secured
4. **Task Completion**: Assigned tasks will eventually achieve consensus and complete successfully

## Security Analysis (STRIDE Threat Model)

- **Spoofing**: Prevented by Ed25519 cryptographic identities and reputation bootstrapping
- **Tampering**: Prevented by redundant computation and cryptographic result verification
- **Repudiation**: Prevented by complete audit logging and non-repudiation signatures
- **Information Disclosure**: Prevented by sandboxed execution and zero user data access
- **Denial of Service**: Prevented by hard resource quotas and graceful degradation
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Prevented by defense-in-depth sandboxing per operating system
